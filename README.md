# Generative AI Meeting Intelligence Application

# Introduction
This project is undertaken with the goal of building a Meeting Intelligence Application. The application allows users to upload audio recordings of the meeting. The Application then processes the audio file to generate the transcript of the meeting and store it in the s3 bucket. The user would be able to select and view the transcript file from a list of processed meetings. The user will also be able to ask questions and gain some insights about the selected meeting using GPT3.5 API.
